# Courses registrator

After a student logs in, they can register for courses or seminar groups of individual courses. The courses and groups are displayed as a list. Each course and group has a specific capacity, teacher, date and time from which to register. Students enrolled in a course are registered. Courses are listed by the semester and by the faculty under which they fall and can only be created/edited by teachers or administrators.
