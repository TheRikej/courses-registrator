# Courses registrator

After a student logs in, they can register for courses or seminar groups of individual courses. The courses and groups are displayed as a list. Each course and group has a specific capacity, teacher, date and time from which to register. Students enrolled in a course are registered. Courses are listed by the semester and by the faculty under which they fall and can only be created/edited by teachers or administrators.


### Must have:

-    at least 5 entities (user, course, group, semester, faculty) are stored in the database
-    responsive design (desktop + mobile)
-    authentication and authorization (teachers can only modify subjects that they have listed, teachers who teach this group can only modify their group, etc...)
-    the application allows CRUD operations on relevant entities within the framework of correct authorization
-    students can list their specific subjects when selecting the correct semester
-    the student can list and filter individual courses by the semester, faculty and title
